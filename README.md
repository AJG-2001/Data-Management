ESG Paper: Who Should Have Access to Stored Communications?

üìå Project Overview

This project critically examines the ethical and legal dilemmas surrounding law enforcement access to encrypted communications under the Stored Communications Act (SCA). It is divided into two parts:

Part A: Personal Reflection ‚Äì A self-assessment of my Reddit and WhatsApp activity over the past 36 months to identify potentially problematic posts and messages, followed by decisions on whether to delete, edit, or keep them.

Part B: Using Data as a Business Model ‚Äì A critical analysis of the challenges courts face in balancing privacy rights with law enforcement needs. Using the Samuel Pina case as a reference, the paper weighs the pros and cons of granting access to encrypted data and provides stakeholder analysis and recommendations.

üîé Key Components
Part A: Personal Reflection

Reviewed Reddit and WhatsApp accounts for problematic content.

Identified three posts/messages that could harm professional reputation:

A frustrated Reddit comment about DoorDash‚Äôs app.

A sarcastic post referencing a ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù sign at Starbucks.

A WhatsApp exchange joking about a false death report of Akira Toriyama.

Decision: Deleted the Reddit posts to maintain professionalism. Chose to keep the WhatsApp exchange, as it was private, contextual, and part of authentic personal interactions
.

Part B: Using Data as a Business Model

Case Study: The Samuel Pina case demonstrated the complexity of accessing encrypted messages in investigations.

Pros of Access: Preventing terrorism/organized crime, aiding investigations (e.g., San Bernardino iPhone case).

Cons of Access: Risks of privacy violations, government overreach, data misuse, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities
.

Stakeholder Analysis:

Law Enforcement: Need access for investigations.

Tech Companies: Maintain consumer trust and secure platforms.

Users/Public: Value privacy and data security.

Civil Rights Advocates: Oppose surveillance overreach.

Recommendations:

Strengthen the SCA with clear legal protocols.

Implement transparency/oversight measures.

Encourage collaboration among law enforcement, tech companies, and advocacy groups
